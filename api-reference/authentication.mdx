description: "How to authenticate requests to the API"
---

Each request to the API must be authenticated with a valid API token. You can find both your public and secret API key in the [API settings](https://app.useplunk.com/settings/api) of your project.

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <team_token>'
```

## Public API Key

Your public API key should be used in environments like the browser or mobile apps. Its only permission is to track events.

## Secret API Key

Your secret API key should be used in environments like your backend server. It has full access to your project, including the ability to delete data and extract emails.
