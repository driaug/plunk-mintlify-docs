You will often want to attach metadata to your contacts. For example, you might want to store their name, address, or the name of their company.

When [tracking events](/api-reference/actions/track), you can attach metadata to the contact. This metadata will be available to view in the dashboard, can be used to [segment contacts](/working-with-contacts/segmentation), and can be used to [personalize messages](/api-reference/actions/personalize).

## Adding metadata
In this example, we will track the event `project-created` and attach the name of the project to the contact.

```javascript
await fetch('https://api.useplunk.com/v1/track', {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer <API_KEY>"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        "event": "new-project",
        "email": "hello@useplunk.com",
        "data": {
            "project": "Plunk"
        }
    })
});
```
