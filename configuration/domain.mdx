Sending emails from your own domain is a great way to build trust with your customers.

## Verifying your domain
When verifying your domain with Plunk, you choose a default sending address for your account. This is the address that we will use to send emails from your domain.

To verify your domain, you need to add 3 CNAME records to your domain. You can find these records in the [project settings](https://app.useplunk.com/settings/identity). Once you have added the records, your domain will be automatically verified.
